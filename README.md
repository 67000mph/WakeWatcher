Project Wake Watchers:
The Wake Watchers project is an interactive alarm clock that encourages users to do exercise after getting up.
A camera recognition system captures and tracks the exercise movements.
By tracking the movements and calculating the angles between the limbs, it is possible to create a counter that only increments when an exercise is performed correctly.
The alarm clock can be deactivated after the successful completion of the prescribed exercises.
